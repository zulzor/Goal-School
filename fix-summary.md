# Fix Summary - Login/Registration Buttons Issue

## Problem
The login and registration buttons on the screen were not working due to JavaScript syntax errors caused by duplicate function definitions.

## Root Cause
Multiple functions were defined multiple times throughout the code, causing JavaScript syntax errors that prevented the onclick event handlers from working properly.

## Functions Fixed
The following functions had duplicate definitions that were removed:

1. `editBranch` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
2. `addBranch` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
3. `editCoach` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
4. `addCoach` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
5. `deleteCoach` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
6. `editStudent` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
7. `deleteStudent` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
8. `addStudent` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
9. `editScheduleItem` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
10. `deleteScheduleItem` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
11. `addScheduleItem` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
12. `editParent` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
13. `deleteParent` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
14. `addParent` - 3 definitions → 1 definition
15. `showApkInfo` - 2 definitions → 1 definition

## Verification
- ✅ All essential functions (`showTab`, `selectRole`, `selectBranch`, `login`, `register`, `testLogin`) are properly exported to the global `window` object
- ✅ All onclick handlers correctly reference their respective functions
- ✅ No duplicate function definitions remain
- ✅ JavaScript syntax is valid

## Solution
Created and ran a script that automatically identified and removed duplicate function definitions, keeping only the first occurrence of each function.

## Result
The login and registration buttons should now work correctly. The user can:
1. Click on the login/register tabs to switch between them
2. Fill in the login form and click the "Войти" button
3. Fill in the registration form and click the "Зарегистрироваться" button
4. Use the role selection and branch selection options
5. Test with the debug buttons if needed

The application should now be fully functional for user authentication and registration.
